# Blind-UnFolded

To make the specially-abled more independent, our project brings out several solutions that will be beneficial for them:
•	Absolute Braille Support
•	Voice-controlled interface with narration accessibility.
•	Integrated real-time Speech to Braille Conversion.
•	Fast Text to Braille Conversion.
•	Braille printing directly from audio, speech, or text inputs.
•	Multi-linguistic GUI support.

Our main aim would be “To implement and demonstrate the use of the software for and by the visual and hearing-impaired people to convert speech to braille printed scripts.”

The proposed work can be improved by adding the feature of conversion of Braille-to-speech with the low error and converting different languages into braille script since it will be helpful to read the data into their own Braille language. By pitching this idea, we can expand our idea to the whole country and the whole world.
